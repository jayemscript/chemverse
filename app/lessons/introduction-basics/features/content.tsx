          Matter can be classified according to physical and chemical
          properties. Matter is anything that occupies space and has mass. The
          three states of matter are solid, liquid, and gas. A physical change
          involves the conversion of a substance from one state of matter to
          another, without changing its chemical composition. Most matter
          consists of mixtures of pure substances, which can be homogeneous
          (uniform in composition) or heterogeneous (different regions possess
          different compositions & properties).

          All matter has physical and chemical properties. Physical properties
          are characteristics that scientists can measure without changing the
          composition of the sample under study, such as mass, color, and
          volume. Chemical properties describe the characteristic ability of a
          substance to react to form new substances; they include its
          flammability and susceptibility to corrosion.

          The natural sciences begin with observation, and this usually involves
          numerical measurements of quantities such as length, volume, density,
          and temperature. Most of these quantities have units of some kind
          associated with them, and these units must be retained when you use
          them in calculations. Measuring units can be defined in terms of a
          very small number of fundamental ones that, through dimensional
          analysis, provide insight into their derivation and meaning.

          Measurements may be accurate, meaning that the measured value is the
          same as the true value; they may be precise, meaning that multiple
          measurements give nearly identical values (i.e., reproducible
          results); they may be both accurate and precise; or they may be
          neither accurate nor precise. The goal of scientists is to obtain
          measured values that are both accurate and precise.

          Dimensional analysis is used in numerical calculations, and in
          converting units. It can help us identify whether an equation is set
          up correctly (i.e. the resulting units should be as expected). Units
          are treated similarly to the associated numerical values, i.e., if a
          variable in an equation is supposed to be squared, then the associated
          dimensions are squared, etc.

            Chemistry is the study of matter and the changes that material
            substances undergo. Of all the scientific disciplines, it is perhaps
            the most extensively connected to other fields of study. A major
            goal of this text is to demonstrate the importance of chemistry in
            your daily life and in our collective understanding of both the
            physical world we occupy and the biological realm of which we are a
            part.
